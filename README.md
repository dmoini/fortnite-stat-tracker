**THE FORTNITE API USED IS PERMANENTLY DOWN, AND THUS THIS WEBSITE DOES NOT WORK. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE SCREENSHOTS FROM THE PREVIOUSLY LIVE WEBSITE, CLICK [HERE](evaluation-and-vision.md).**

This is a web application that uses the [Fortnite API](https://fortniteapi.com/) to search for player stats, view items in the daily shop, and view weekly challenges from any week.

To perform development tasks such as testing and linting, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed. In order to get going, run `npm install`:
     
     $ cd fortnite-stat-tracker
     $ npm install
 
The installation allows you to run the web app locally. In this folderâ€™s location, just type `npm start`:
 
     $ cd fortnite-stat-tracker
     $ npm start
